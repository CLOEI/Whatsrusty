# Whatsapp-Rust (whatsmeow Port)

This project is a Rust port of the core functionalities of the Go-based `whatsmeow` library. The goal is to create a robust, type-safe, and performant Rust library for interacting with the WhatsApp platform using modern and idiomatic async Rust.

This document outlines the migration progress and the current state of the project.

## Project Goals

- **Type Safety:** Leverage Rust's strong type system to eliminate entire classes of bugs.
- **Performance:** Utilize Rust's performance for efficient handling of binary protocols and cryptography.
- **Concurrency:** Build a modern asynchronous architecture using Tokio for high-throughput event processing.
- **Modularity:** Maintain a clean, modular architecture similar to `whatsmeow` to ensure the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

## Migration Status

### Legend

- `‚úÖ` **Completed**: The feature is fully implemented and considered stable.
- `‚è≥` **In Progress / Partially Implemented**: The feature is under active development or has a partial implementation.
- `üìã` **Planned**: The feature has not yet been started but is the next priority.
- `[ ]` **Not Started**: The feature has not yet been implemented.

### 1. Foundation & Core Primitives

These modules form the bedrock of the library and are prerequisites for any higher-level functionality.

- `‚úÖ` **Protocol Buffers (`proto/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Cryptography Utilities (`crypto/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Binary Protocol (`binary/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Core Types (`types/`)**

---

### 2. Connection & Authentication

This section covers establishing and securing the connection to WhatsApp's servers.

- `‚úÖ` **Socket Layer (`socket/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Authentication Handshake (`handshake.rs`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Pairing Logic (QR Code, `pair.rs`, `qrcode.rs`)**

---

### 3. Main Client & Event Loop

This is the primary orchestrator that brings all other modules together.

- `‚úÖ` **Client Struct & Main Loop (`client.rs`)**
- `‚úÖ` **IQ (Info/Query) Handling (`request.rs`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Keepalive Loop (`keepalive.rs`)**
- `‚è≥` **App State Synchronization (`appstate/`)**:
  - `‚úÖ` Logic to fetch app state patches from the server.
  - `‚è≥` **Current Status:** The client can receive and decrypt app state patches. The next step is to process these patches to populate contacts, chats, and other client state.

---

### 4. End-to-End Encryption (Signal Protocol)

The core of the end-to-end encryption implementation.

- `‚úÖ` **Session Management (`signal/session.rs`)**:
  - `‚úÖ` Decryption of both `PreKeySignalMessage` and `SignalMessage` is working correctly.
  - `‚úÖ` Encryption for 1-on-1 chats is implemented, correctly handling multi-device `DeviceSentMessage` payloads.
- `‚úÖ` **Core Protocol Structs (`signal/`)**: Identity, Keys, Ratchet, etc., have been ported and are in use.
- `‚úÖ` **Store Traits & Implementations (`store/`, `signal/store.rs`)**: The necessary traits and backend implementations for the protocol are defined and functional.

---

## Roadmap & Next Steps

The project has achieved a major milestone: a stable, authenticated, and end-to-end encrypted connection. The client can successfully pair, connect, and exchange messages with other WhatsApp clients, including handling the multi-device synchronization protocol correctly.

The current focus is on building out higher-level features and improving the robustness of the client.

### Phase 1: Full App State and Event Handling (Current Focus)

1.  **Process App State Mutations**:

    - **Task**: Implement the logic in `appstate/processor.rs` to take the decrypted `Mutation` objects and apply them to the client's store. This includes updating contacts, chat settings (mute, archive), and more.
    - **Why**: This will give the client awareness of the user's account state and is essential for a fully-featured bot or client.

2.  **Expand Event Emitter**:
    - **Task**: As app state and other notifications are processed, emit more specific events (e.g., `Event::ContactUpdate`, `Event::ChatUpdate`) for the library user to consume.
    - **Why**: A rich event system is crucial for building interactive applications.

### Phase 2: Group Messaging and Media

1.  **Implement Group Messaging**:

    - **Task**: Port the `SenderKey` (SKMSG) part of the Signal Protocol. This involves creating, distributing, and using sender keys to encrypt and decrypt messages in group chats.
    - **Why**: This is the next major E2EE feature required for interacting with groups.

2.  **Implement Media Uploads/Downloads**:
    - **Task**: Add support for encrypting/uploading and downloading/decrypting media files (images, videos, documents). This involves handling media connection details (`mediaconn.rs`).
    - **Why**: Essential for any client that needs to handle more than just text.

### Phase 3: Robustness and Feature Parity

1.  **Full `usync` Implementation**: Implement a robust `get_user_devices` function using `usync` IQs to ensure device lists are always up-to-date.
2.  **Expand Node Handlers**: Implement handlers for receipts, presence, and other notification types to achieve closer feature parity with `whatsmeow`.
