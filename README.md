# Whatsapp-Rust (whatsmeow Port)

This project is a Rust port of the core functionalities of the Go-based `whatsmeow` library. The goal is to create a robust, type-safe, and performant Rust library for interacting with the WhatsApp platform using modern and idiomatic async Rust.

This document outlines the migration progress and the current state of the project.

## Project Goals

- **Type Safety:** Leverage Rust's strong type system to eliminate entire classes of bugs.
- **Performance:** Utilize Rust's performance for efficient handling of binary protocols and cryptography.
- **Concurrency:** Build a modern asynchronous architecture using Tokio for high-throughput event processing.
- **Modularity:** Maintain a clean, modular architecture similar to `whatsmeow` to ensure the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

## Migration Status

### Legend

- `‚úÖ` **Completed**: The feature is fully implemented and considered stable.
- `‚è≥` **In Progress / Partially Implemented**: The feature is under active development or has a partial implementation.
- `üìã` **Planned**: The feature has not yet been started but is the next priority.
- `[ ]` **Not Started**: The feature has not yet been implemented.

### 1. Foundation & Core Primitives

These modules form the bedrock of the library. They are prerequisites for any higher-level functionality.

- `‚úÖ` **Protocol Buffers (`proto/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Cryptography Utilities (`crypto/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Binary Protocol (`binary/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Core Types (`types/`)**

---

### 2. Connection & Authentication

This section covers establishing and securing the connection to WhatsApp's servers.

- `‚úÖ` **Socket Layer (`socket/`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Authentication Handshake (`handshake.rs`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Pairing Logic (`pair.rs`, `qrcode.rs`)**

---

### 3. Main Client & Event Loop

This is the primary orchestrator that brings all other modules together.

- `‚úÖ` **Client Struct (`client.rs`)**
- `‚úÖ` **IQ (Info/Query) Handling (`request.rs`)**
- `‚úÖ` **Keepalive Loop (`keepalive.rs`)**
- `‚è≥` **App State Synchronization (`appstate/`)**:
  - `‚úÖ` Logic to fetch app state patches from the server.
  - `‚è≥` **Current Status:** The client correctly triggers app state syncs but cannot yet decrypt the patches. This is blocked by the Signal Protocol implementation.

---

### 4. End-to-End Encryption (Signal Protocol)

The core of the end-to-end encryption. **This is the current major implementation area.**

- `‚è≥` **Session Management (`signal/session.rs`)**:
  - `‚è≥` Decrypting `PreKeySignalMessage` is the immediate next step.
  - `[ ]` Encrypting and sending messages.
- `‚úÖ` **Core Protocol Structs (`signal/`)**: Identity, Keys, Ratchet, etc., have been ported.
- `‚úÖ` **Store Traits (`signal/store.rs`)**: The necessary traits for the protocol are defined.

---

## Roadmap & Next Steps

The project has achieved a stable, authenticated connection. The next critical phase is to implement the Signal Protocol decryption flow. This will unblock app state synchronization and enable the client to receive and process messages.

### Phase 1: Implement Signal Protocol Decryption (Current Focus)

1.  **Implement `SessionCipher::decrypt`**:

    - **Task**: Flesh out the `decrypt` method in `src/signal/session.rs` by porting the logic from `go.mau.fi/libsignal/session/SessionCipher.go`. This involves handling `PreKeySignalMessage` and `SignalMessage` types.
    - **Why**: This is required to decrypt the initial `AppStateSyncKeyShare` message, which is the blocker for all other app state processing.

2.  **Integrate Decryption into the Client**:

    - **Task**: In `client.rs`, use the new `SessionCipher` to decrypt incoming `<enc>` nodes.
    - **Why**: This connects the protocol implementation to the main client event loop.

3.  **Implement `AppStateSyncKeyShare` Handling**:
    - **Task**: Once a message is decrypted, check if it contains `AppStateSyncKeyShare`. If it does, store the keys in the `AppStateKeyStore`.
    - **Why**: This will resolve the "No app state sync key found" warnings and allow app state syncs to complete successfully.

### Phase 2: Message and App State Handling

1.  **Complete App State Processing**: With keys available, the `appstate::Processor` will be able to fully decrypt and apply patches. This will populate contacts, chats, etc.
2.  **Handle Plaintext Messages**: Add logic to handle decrypted `wa::Message` payloads and emit them as `Event::Message`.

### Phase 3: Sending Messages and Feature Expansion

1.  **Implement Message Sending**: Create a high-level `send_text_message` function that uses the Signal Protocol to encrypt messages.
2.  **Expand Node Handlers**: Implement handlers for receipts, presence, and other notification types.
